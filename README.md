# Thingiverse Zip Download Chrome Extension
An extension for Google Chrome (and derivatives) that returns functionality to the "Download All Files" button on Thingiverse's website

## How it works
This extension is a very small script that Google's Chrome browser will execute on all pages on the matching the patterns `https://*.thingiverse.com/thing:*`, `https://thingiverse.com/thing:*`. All it does is look for the `Download All Files` button by class, and adds an href to it to the current thing's url + `/zip`
